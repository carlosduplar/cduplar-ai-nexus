Not afraid to go fully hands on and ensure the specifications were as clear to us as possible by conducting full User Research, his work has become the staple of what we expected from a Product Owner: clear, concise User Stories and task information, as well as having a consistent user/stakeholder feedback loop. He has always gone above and beyond in his role, ensuring we had the support and knowledge we need to do our development work, resulting in our team's very rapid efficiency in handing over results, even under tight delivery times. He is an asset to which ever team he will be in and it has been a pleasure to work with him."

From the very beginning, he impressed me with his adaptability and flexibility. He quickly found his footing in a complex technical environment and showed an exceptional ability to absorb and make sense of large amounts of information.\n\nCarlos brings a strong work ethic to everything he does. He tackles challenges head-on, stays focused under pressure, and is genuinely committed to delivering high-quality results. He also has a talent for finding creative and innovative solutions, especially in situations where standard approaches fall short.\n\nHis multilingual skills in English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese have been a real asset in our international context, helping him communicate effectively across teams and cultures.\n\nWhat stands out most is his resilience. No matter how priorities shift or deadlines tighten, Carlos remains calm, focused, and solution-oriented. His curiosity and willingness to keep learning play a big role in his success as a Product Owner in our digital initiatives.\n\nI continue to enjoy working with Carlos and greatly value the professionalism, insight, and positive energy he brings to the team. I recommend him wholeheartedly for roles that demand strategic thinking, creativity, and a collaborative spirit."
